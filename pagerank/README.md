## Specification

Complete the implementation of `transition_model`, `sample_pagerank`, and `compute_pagerank`.

The `transition_model` should return a dictionary representing the probability distribution over which page a random surfer would visit next, given a corpus of pages, a current page, and a damping factor.

- The function accepts three arguments: `corpus`, `page`, and `damping_factor`.
    - The `corpus` is a Python dictionary mapping a page name to a set of all pages linked to by that page.
    - The `page` is a string representing which page the random surfer is currently on.
    - The `damping_factor` is a floating point number representing the damping factor to be used when generating the probabilities.
- The return value of the function should be a Python dictionary with one key for each page in the corpus. Each key should be mapped to a value representing the probability that a random surfer would choose that page next. The values in this returned probability distribution should sum to `1`.
    - With probability `damping_factor`, the random surfer should randomly choose one of the links from `page` with equal probability.
    - With probability `1 - damping_factor`, the random surfer should randomly choose one of all pages in the corpus with equal probability.
- For example, if the `corpus` were `{"1.html": {"2.html", "3.html"}, "2.html": {"3.html"}, "3.html": {"2.html"}}`, the `page` was `"1.html"`, and the `damping_factor` was `0.85`, then the output of `transition_model` should be `{"1.html": 0.05, "2.html": 0.475, "3.html": 0.475}`. This is because with probability `0.85`, we choose randomly to go from page 1 to either page 2 or page 3 (so each of page 2 or page 3 has probability `0.425` to start), but every page gets an additional `0.05` because with probability `0.15` we choose randomly among all three of the pages.
- If `page` has no outgoing links, then `transition_model` should return a probability distribution that chooses randomly among all pages with equal probability. (In other words, if a page has no links, we can pretend it has links to all pages in the corpus, including itself.)

The `sample_pagerank` function should accept a corpus of web pages, a damping factor, and a number of samples, and return an estimated PageRank for each page.

- The function accepts three arguments: `corpus`, a `damping_factor`, and `n`.
    - The `corpus` is a Python dictionary mapping a page name to a set of all pages linked to by that page.
    - The `damping_factor` is a floating point number representing the damping factor to be used by the transition model.
    - `n` is an integer representing the number of samples that should be generated to estimate PageRank values.
- The return value of the function should be a Python dictionary with one key for each page in the corpus. Each key should be mapped to a value representing that page’s estimated PageRank (i.e., the proportion of all the samples that corresponded to that page). The values in this dictionary should sum to 1.
- The first sample should be generated by choosing from a page at random.
- For each of the remaining samples, the next sample should be generated from the previous sample based on the previous sample’s transition model.
    - You will likely want to pass the previous sample into your `transition_model` function, along with the `corpus` and the `damping_factor`, to get the probabilities for the next sample.
    - For example, if the transition probabilities are `{"1.html": 0.05, "2.html": 0.475, "3.html": 0.475}`, then 5% of the time the next sample generated should be `"1.html"`, 47.5% of the time the next sample generated should be `"2.html"`, and 47.5% of the time the next sample generated should be `"3.html"`.
- You may assume that `n` will be at least `1`.

The `iterate_pagerank` function should accept a corpus of web pages and a damping factor, calculate PageRanks based on the iteration formula described above, and return each page’s PageRank accurate to within `0.001`.

- The function accepts two arguments: `corpus` and `damping_factor`.
    - The `corpus` is a Python dictionary mapping a page name to a set of all pages linked to by that page.
    - The `damping_factor` is a floating point number representing the damping factor to be used in the PageRank formula.
- The return value of the function should be a Python dictionary with one key for each page in the corpus. Each key should be mapped to a value representing that page’s PageRank. The values in this dictionary should sum to `1`.
- The function should begin by assigning each page a rank of `1 / N`, where `N` is the total number of pages in the corpus.
- The function should then repeatedly calculate new rank values based on all of the current rank values, according to the PageRank formula in the “Background” section. (i.e., calculating a page’s PageRank based on the PageRanks of all pages that link to it).
    - A page that has no links at all should be interpreted as having one link for every page in the corpus (including itself).
- This process should repeat until no PageRank value changes by more than `0.001` between the current rank values and the new rank values.

You should not modify anything else in `pagerank.py` other than the three functions the specification calls for you to implement, though you may write additional functions and/or import other Python standard library modules. You may also import `numpy` or `pandas`, if familiar with them, but you should not use any other third-party Python modules.
